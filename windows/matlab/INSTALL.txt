mcc_ssr08 - mex file installation instructions
---------------------------------------------

Requirements:

1. Matlab 2010a or later (I think). I've only tested it with 2010a.

2. Measurement Computing's Universal Library version 6.0. Use the CD accompanying 
   the device or download from Measurement Computing 
   http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-SSR-Series.aspx 

   If you downloaded you will want to install InstaCal and Universal Library.

3. Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0 - for compiling the mex file. Matlab's lcc compiler
   will not work. 

   For this I used the free version "Visual Studio Express 2010" which can be
   downloaded from here http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#

   Note, in order to get the visual studio express 2010 compiler to work with
   Matlab 2010a it is necessary to apply a patch to Matlab. The patch can be
   downloaded from here: 
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-D5W493/?solution=1-D5W493

   Follow the instructions on the page. Note, the patch is given on the bottom
   of the page: VS2010MEXSupport.zip 

   The instructions come boil down to applying the patch by running 

   unzip('path to zip file', matlabroot) 

   from the Matlab command prompt and

   mex -setup

   also from the matlab command prompt during which you should select the 
   Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express compiler.
   
   Depending on your setting you may need to run Matlab as an administrator in
   order to run the commands above.

4. Mercurial (if you want to use revision control)

   Download from here: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

   If you want to use mercurial from the command line check to make sure that
   mercurial is on your windows path.
   
   Typing hg and the command prompt should give you a basic help message.


Building the mex file:
----------------------

1. Download the project files to the location of your choice. The top level
   directory of the project should be called mcc_ssr08. 
   
2. Start Matlab and changed directory to the mcc_ssr08\windows\matlab directory.

3. Run the command buid_mcc_ssr08. If all goes well it should run quietly - no
   messages.

Installation:
-------------

1. Add the directory mcc_ssr08\windows\matlab to your Matlab path.
